Basement
Creepy scary dark basement. If you're too scared you can go back up the stairs into the kitchen. The light bulb seems to be missing so the room is too dark to rummage through.

Stairs
The second floor of your house, photos of you and your family fill up their floor. There is a modern looking chest on this floor. You can go back downstairs to the living room, west into your bedroom, or north to go further down in the hall way. 
#
Hallway
Nothing interesting about more photos of your family. You can go south back to the stairs or east in your sisters room. Only if you dare.

Your Room
The coolest room in history! There is a blueKey on your desk. You can stay in this room and never leave the comfort of your own room, or east back to the top of the stairs.
